<h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a saucepan with cold water and place over medium heat</li>
                <li>Stir in vinegar and bring to a gentle, slow simmer</li>
                <li>Working with one egg at a time, crack an egg into a ramekin or measuring cup for easier transfer</li>
                <li>Stir the water vigorously to create a whirlpool effect. As the whirlpool is turning, drop the egg into the center of the water</li>
                <li>Continue to stir gently, cooking until the egg white turns opaque</li>
                <li>Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the egg from the water and move to a paper towel-lined plate to drain</li>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, set up a dredging station with 3 separate bowls. To the first bowl, add the flour</li>
                <li>Beat 2 eggs with salt and pepper in a second bowl</li>
                <li>Add breadcrumbs to the third bowl</li>
                <li>Carefully dip the cooled egg first into the flour, second into the egg mixture, and last into the breadcrumbs, coating egg on all sides at each station</li>
                <li>Using a slotted spoon, carefully drop the egg into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to overcook</li>
                <li>Drain on a paper-towel lined plate</li>
                <li>Garnish with pickled red onions, green onions, and red pepper flakes. Serve immediately</li>
